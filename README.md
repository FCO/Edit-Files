NAME
====

Edit::Files - edit a given set of files

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Edit::Files;

edit-files(@files, :editor<vim>);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Edit::Files attempts to provide an abstract interface to editing a set of files, with optional line number and column number specifications.

EXPORTED SUBROUTINES
====================

edit-files
----------

```raku
# edit files "foo" and "bar" with vim
edit-files(<foo bar>, :editor<vim>);

# edit file "foo" at line 42, file "bar" at line 666 with default editor
edit-files( (foo => 42,  bar => 666) );

# edit file "foo" at line 42, column 3 and file "bar" with default editor
edit-files( (foo => 42 => 3,  "bar") );
```

The `edit-files` subroutine slurps the given file specifications and calls the (implicitely) specified editor to edit these files.

The files can be specified in 3 ways:

  * just as a filename

  * a Pair with filename as key, and line number as value

  * a Pair with filename as key, and a line number => column Pair as value

SUPPORTED EDITORS
=================

At this writing, only `vim` is supported.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

Thanks to Damian Conway for showing the way to handle multiple files / lines using the compilation error `-q` feature of `vim`.
